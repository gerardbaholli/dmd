\section{Data Types and Format}

\subsection{Text}
The document is written in \LaTeX\ so all the new chapters inserted in the document must be written in a \textit{.tex} file and then be included in the \textit{main.tex}. Keep in mind that all the formatting rules are contained in the main.tex so if you want to create new documents make a copy of the main.tex file and start from that.

\subsection{Pictures}
Different formats are allowed for the images to be uploaded, but in some cases it's important to respect the dimensions contained below:

\begin{center}
